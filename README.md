# MCT-Device
The goal of this project is to develop and test a simulator for embedded software used in micro-current biofeedback devices. This is a medical device that delivers modulated electrical signals via an electrode through the skin to communicate with the peripheral nervous system. The project is implemented and tested in C++ using Qt Creator IDE.
